# Classic Connect Four 
A simple connect four browser game written JS, HTML and CSS. Though I must say it was a lot harder than I initially thought, trying to minimize looping while coming up with the algorithm to check if a player has won. Instead of storing every single win pattern in memory and then looping over them one by one. I created 4 smaller loops that only check the possible patterns for the last placed marker. One slot has a maximum of 12 different win patterns, with a maximum of 3 per axis (horizontal, vertical and two diagonal). So basically I was able to keep the looping to a mininum and get an almost instant output. All in all a fun project.
